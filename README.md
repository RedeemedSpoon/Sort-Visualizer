## Introduction

This interactive Sort Visualizer is a web application designed to bring sorting algorithms to life. Whether you're a programmer, student, or curious about how data is organized, this tool allows you to see various sorting algorithms in action.

## How To Use

- **Choose an Algorithm:** Select the sorting algorithm you want to visualize from the menu list.
- **Array Size:** Choose the desired size of the array set you want to sort.
- **Speed Controls:** You can use speed controls to adjust the animation speed to slow down or speed up.
- **Run Visualization:** Click the "Run" button to start the visualization.
- **View Stats:** You can easily view the number of comparisons and swaps that took place during the visualization as well as the time it took to sort the data.
