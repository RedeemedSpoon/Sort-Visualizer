## Introduction

This interactive [Sorts-Visualizer](https://sorts-visualizer.onrender.com) is a web application designed to bring sorting algorithms to life. Whether you're a programmer, student, or curious about how data is organized, this tool allows you to see various sorting algorithms in action.

## How To Use

- **Choose an Algorithm:** Select the sorting algorithm you want to visualize from the menu list.
- **Shuffle Array:** Click the "Shuffle" button to shuffle the array.
- **Change Array Size:** Choose the desired size of the array set you want to sort.
