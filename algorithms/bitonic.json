  "Date": "1960s",
  "Author": "Kenneth E. Batcher",
  "Description": "Bitonic sort is a sorting algorithm designed for parallel computing environments. It operates on a bitonic sequence (a sequence that is first increasing and then decreasing, or vice versa). The algorithm recursively divides the sequence into smaller bitonic sub-sequences and sorts them using a specific compare-swap operation.\n\n Bitonic sort leverages the capabilities of parallel processors to achieve efficient sorting. However, its practical use often requires specialized hardware or algorithms tailored for parallel execution.",
