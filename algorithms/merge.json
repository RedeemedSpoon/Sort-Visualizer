  "Description": "Merge sort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm that excels in sorting linked lists or arrays. It works by recursively dividing the input data structure into smaller sub-arrays containing a single element each (base case).\n\nIn the merge phase, adjacent sub-arrays are combined while maintaining the sorted order. This is achieved by comparing elements from both sub-arrays and inserting the smaller one into the final merged sub-array. This process continues until all sub-arrays are merged into a single sorted array.",
