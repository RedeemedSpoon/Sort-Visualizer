  "Description": "Pancake sort, despite its intriguing name, operates on a more theoretical level. It envisions an array of elements like pancakes on a griddle. The algorithm involves 'flipping' subsequences within the array to bring the largest element to the end. This process is repeated, progressively reducing the unsorted portion of the array.\n\nPancake sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²) but finds application in some theoretical computer science problems. However, due to its flipping operation being impractical for most real-world implementations, it's not commonly used for practical sorting tasks.",
