  "Description": "Spaghetti sort, similar to bead sort, is a theoretical sorting algorithm that involves manipulating physical spaghetti strands. The strands are initially mixed, and then sorting is achieved by repeatedly picking a random pair of strands and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. Due to its reliance on physical manipulation and randomness, spaghetti sort is not a practical sorting method for most applications.",
