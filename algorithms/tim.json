  "Description": "Timsort is a hybrid sorting algorithm that combines the strengths of insertion sort and merge sort. It is often used in Java's Arrays.sort() method due to its efficiency for most real-world data sets.\n\nTimsort initially partitions the input array into runs (partially sorted sub-arrays). For small runs, insertion sort is applied for its speed. When merging larger runs, a variant of merge sort is employed, optimized for already partially sorted data. This hybrid approach makes Timsort generally faster than pure insertion sort or merge sort for most data.",
